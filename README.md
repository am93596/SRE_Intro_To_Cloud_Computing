**SRE introduction**
- What is the role of SRE?
	- SREs are responsible for the reliability of a service
	- They ensure that a service is tested in all potential scenarios, and that risks and errors are identified early (ideally before the customer notices) and resolved quickly and smoothly


**Cloud Computing**
- What is Cloud Computing and the benefits of using it?
	- Cloud Computing is the renting of a cloud computing company's servers.
	- Benefits:
		- It's cheaper for companies to only pay for the servers they use than to buy their own
		- The company can monitor their service live
		- The company can stress-test a service to make sure it can handle extreme cases, e.g. more users than expected


**What is Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- What is AWS and benefits of using it
	- AWS is a provider of on-demand cloud platforms
	- Benefits:
		- Pay-as-you-go
		- Easy to scale up/down based on your needs - auto-scale
		- AWS take care of the care required to keep a physical server running efficiently


**What is SDLC and stages of SDLC**
- What is SDLC and what are the stages of it?
	- The Software Development Life Cycle is the series of steps that are involved in developing working, robust software
	- Stages:
		- Planning
		- Design
		- Building
		- Testing
		- Deploying
		- Maintaining


**What are the Risk levels at each stage of SDLC?**
- LOW
- MEDIUM
- HIGH
	- Planning: LOW
	- Design: LOW
	- Building: LOW/MEDIUM
	- Testing: LOW/MEDIUM
	- Deploying: HIGH
	- Maintaining: HIGH
